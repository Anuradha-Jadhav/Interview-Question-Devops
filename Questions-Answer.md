Here are the answers based on your 5 years of experience as a DevOps Engineer:

### **CI/CD Pipeline Explanation**  
Currently, I am working on a CI/CD pipeline that automates code builds, tests, and deployments using Jenkins/GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps. The pipeline includes:  
- **CI (Continuous Integration):** Developers push code to Git, triggering automated builds and unit tests.  
- **CD (Continuous Deployment):** Successful builds are deployed to different environments using Ansible/Terraform/Kubernetes.  
- **Stages:** Code checkout â†’ Build â†’ Unit Test â†’ Security Scan â†’ Deploy â†’ Post-Deployment Tests.  

---

### **Deployment Groups & Branching Strategies in CI/CD**  
- **Deployment Groups:** Logical grouping of servers where deployments happen (e.g., Dev, QA, Staging, Production). In Azure DevOps, we use agent-based deployments for controlled rollouts.  
- **Branching Strategies:**  
  - **GitFlow:** Feature, Develop, Release, Hotfix branches.  
  - **Trunk-based development:** All changes are merged into `main/master`.  
  - **GitHub Flow:** Simple feature branching with direct merges.

### **Building a CI/CD Pipeline for Separate Environments in Parallel**  
To deploy Dev, Preprod, and Prod environments in parallel:  
1. **Use Parallel Jobs in Jenkins/Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions** to run deployments simultaneously.  
2. **Separate Configuration Files:** Store environment-specific configs in YAML or `.tfvars` files.  
3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform/Ansible dynamically provisions resources for different environments.  
4. **Approval Gates in CD:** Only deploy to production after manual approval.  

---

### **Triggers in a CI/CD Pipeline**  
Triggers define when a pipeline runs.  
- **Commit-based triggers:** Auto-triggered when a developer pushes changes to Git.  
- **Scheduled triggers:** Runs at specific times (e.g., nightly builds).  
- **Manual triggers:** Needs user approval before execution.  
- **Webhooks:** Triggered by external services (e.g., JIRA, Slack, DockerHub).  

---

### **Build Agents in CI/CD**  
Build agents are machines that execute pipeline jobs.  
- **Self-hosted agents:** Installed on our infrastructure for control and customization.  
- **Cloud-hosted agents:** Provided by CI/CD services (e.g., Azure DevOps, GitHub Runners).  
- **Dockerized agents:** Ephemeral agents running in containers for isolated builds.  

---

### **Managing Secrets in CI/CD**  
To avoid exposing sensitive information:  
- **Azure Key Vault/HashiCorp Vault:** Stores secrets securely.  
- **Environment Variables:** Store credentials at runtime instead of hardcoding.  
- **Kubernetes Secrets:** For managing secrets in Kubernetes deployments.  
- **GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps Secret Store:** Encrypts and injects secrets dynamically.  

---

### **SDLC & Agile Methodology**  
- **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle):** Includes phases like Planning, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance.  
- **Agile:** Iterative development approach with sprints, stand-ups, and continuous feedback. Uses frameworks like Scrum and Kanban.  

---

### **Git and Git Stages**  
- **Git Add:** Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area.  
- **Git Commit:** Saves staged changes in the local repository.  
- **Git Push:** Pushes committed changes to the remote repository.  
- **Git Fetch:** Retrieves updates from the remote repository but doesnâ€™t merge.  
- **Git Stash:** Temporarily saves uncommitted changes.  

**Managing Code Conflicts:**  
- Use `git rebase` and `git merge`.  
- Resolve conflicts manually using `git diff`.  
- Use `git log` to check commit history.  

---

### **Terraform & Ansible (IaC Tools)**  
- **Terraform:** Used for provisioning infrastructure.  
- **Ansible:** Used for configuration management.  

---

### **Terraform State & Blocks**  
- **Terraform State File:** Tracks infrastructure changes.  
- **Terraform Blocks:**  
  - **Resource Block:** Defines infrastructure components.  
  - **Variable Block:** Defines input variables.  

**Managing Existing Cloud Resources:**  
- Use `terraform import` to bring existing resources under Terraform control.  

---

### **Maven & Commands**  
- **Maven:** Java-based build automation tool.  
- **`mvn clean install`:** Cleans previous builds and installs dependencies.  
- **`pom.xml`:** Configuration file for dependencies and build settings.  

---

## **Kubernetes Concepts**  

### **Kubernetes Cluster**  
A Kubernetes cluster consists of:  
- **Master Node:** Controls the cluster.  
- **Worker Nodes:** Run applications in Pods.  
- **ETCD:** Stores cluster state.  

### **Probes in Kubernetes**  
- **Liveness Probe:** Checks if a pod is running.  
- **Readiness Probe:** Determines if a pod is ready to receive traffic.  
- **Startup Probe:** Checks if an application has started properly.  

### **Networking in Kubernetes**  
- **Cluster IP:** Internal service communication.  
- **NodePort:** Exposes services on a static port.  
- **LoadBalancer:** External access to services.  
- **Ingress:** Manages external traffic via domain names.  

---

## **Azure Cloud Concepts**  

### **Azure Services Overview**  
- **Bastion:** Secure access to Azure VMs without exposing public IPs.  
- **VNet & VNet Peering:** Isolated network for Azure resources and interconnects multiple VNets.  
- **Azure Storage Account:** Stores blobs, files, queues, and tables.  
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** Manages user permissions.  
- **Load Balancers:** Distributes traffic across VMs.  
- **VMSS (Virtual Machine Scale Sets):** Auto-scales VM instances.  
- **Azure Storage Tiers:**  
  - **Hot:** Frequently accessed data.  
  - **Cool:** Infrequently accessed data.  
  - **Archive:** Rarely accessed data.  

---

## **Ansible Concepts**  

### **Modules & Ad-hoc Commands**  
- **Modules:** Predefined tasks in Ansible.  
- **Ad-hoc Commands:** One-time task execution. Example: `ansible all -m ping`.  

**Difference:**  
- Modules are reusable, while ad-hoc commands are for quick tasks.  

### **Handlers & Dry Run**  
- **Handlers:** Execute tasks only when notified.  
- **Dry Run:** Use `ansible-playbook --check` to validate playbooks.  

### **Example Playbook (OS Patching)**  
```yaml
- name: OS Patching
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update packages
      apt:
        upgrade: yes
        update_cache: yes
```

---

## **Shell Scripting Concepts**  

### **Shebang & Loops**  
- **Shebang (`#!`)** defines the interpreter (e.g., `#!/bin/bash`).  
- **Loops:** `for`, `while`, `until`.  

### **Environment Variables**  
- Set using `export VAR=value`.  
- Access using `$VAR`.  

### **Shell Script to Show Filesystem Full**  
```bash
#!/bin/bash
df -h | awk '$5 ~ /[8-9][0-9]%|100%/{print $0}'
```

### **Shell Script to Backup Logs with Date**  
```bash
#!/bin/bash
backup_dir="/var/logs/backup"
mkdir -p $backup_dir
tar -czf "$backup_dir/logs_$(date +%F).tar.gz" /var/logs/*.log
```
